      <h3>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAAN AND PITA</h3>
      <p>
        Naan is a traditional flatbread made in South and Central Asian
        countries, while pita bread is eaten in the Mediterranean and the Middle
        East.
      </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tsp dry active yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/2-3 cups flour, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water. Stir to
          dissolve then let sit for a few minutes or until it is frothy on top.
          Once frothy, whisk in the oil, yogurt, and egg until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate medium bowl, combine <b>1 cup</b> of the flour with
          the salt. Next, pour the bowl of wet ingredients to the flour/salt
          mixture and stir until well combined. Continue adding flour, a half
          cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon (about 1
          to 1.5 cups later).
        </li>
        <li>
          At that point, turn the ball of dough out onto a lightly floured
          surface and knead the ball of dough for about 3 minutes, adding small
          amounts of flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. You'll
          end up using between 2.5 to 3 cups flour total. The dough should be
          smooth and very soft but not sticky. Avoid adding excessive amounts of
          flour as you knead, as this can make the dough too dry and stiff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size (about 1
          hour). After it rises, gently flatten the dough into a disc and cut it
          into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Working with
          one ball at a time, roll it out until it is about 1/4 inch thick or
          approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place the rolled out dough onto
          the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown and large
          bubbles have formed on the surface (see photos below). Flip the dough
          and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Stack the cooked
          flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm as you cook
          the remaining pieces. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and
          sprinkled with herbs!
