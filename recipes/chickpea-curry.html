      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 inch fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>8 oz. spinach (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 15oz. can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 15oz. cans chickpeas</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger on a small
          holed cheese grater. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger in a large
          skillet with the olive oil over medium heat until the onions have
          softened (3-5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the curry powder and continue to sauté with the onion mixture for
          one minute more. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the skillet along with
          the fresh spinach and continue to sauté until the spinach has wilted.
          The water will help steam and wilt the spinach (no water needed if
          using frozen spinach).
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Add them to the skillet along with the
          tomato sauce. Stir well to distribute the spices in the sauce and heat
          through (5 minutes). Serve over rice or with bread.
